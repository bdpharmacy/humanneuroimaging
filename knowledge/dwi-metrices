FA reflects the degree of alignment of cellular structures within the fiber tracts and their structural integrity. Because glial proliferation results in structurally disorganized tissue, gliosis results in decreased FA and increased ADC.
Factors that may increase the diffusivity in WM include the following: 
  1) wider packing of axons
  2) more permeable myelin sheaths
  3) more obliquely oriented axons
  4) altered radius of individual axons
  5) increased extracellular space
  6) the presence (or absence) of elements other than myelin sheaths within these structures that alter water diffusion
  7) hypomyelination. 

MD is positively correlated with the amount of water in tissues and is thought to reflect the overall tissue water content [7]. A greater density of cellular structures in tissues, such as capillaries, synapses, and macromolecular proteins, is expected to decrease MD, as are changes in the shapes of neurons or glia and the directionality of tissue organization (e.g., by strengthening of the axonal or dendritic backbones and the surrounding tissues) [5, 8, 9]. However, MD is not specific to any one of these changes [10].
