Brain screening protocol (MRI)
Simple non-contrast MRI protocol - mainly for use in pain, not studies.

T1 weighted

plane: saggital (or volumetric 3D)
sequence: fast-spin echo (T1 FSE) or gradient (T1 MPRAGE)
purpose: anatomical overview
T2 weighted

plane: axial
sequence: T2 FSE
purpose: evaluations of basal cisterns, ventricular system and subdural spaces, and good visualization of flow voids in vessels
FLAIR

plane: axial
sequence: FLAIR
purpose: assessment of white matter disorders
Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)

plane: axial
sequence: DWI B=0, B=1000 and ADC
purpose: multiple (identification of stroke to demyelination)
Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI)

plane: axial
sequence: susceptibility weighted imaging (ideal) or T2*
purpose: identify blood products or calcification
